- What do the polarity scores and sentiment mean? -

Polarity: These polarity scores are based on the VADER Lexicon for sentiment
analysis of texts, which can be found here: 

Essentially, by using VADER's rating of how "positive" or "negative" certain words
and emojis are. We then apply the lexicon to each tweet downloaded by tweepy, which
gives us polarities of each words used in a tweet, and by summing up all those values,
we get a polarity score for each tweet.

A low polarity score does not necessarily mean that tweet is divisive or full of negativity (though it could be); it simply means that the words used in that tweet are deemed to be negative by the VADER Lexicon.

Sentiment: By calculating the average polarity score for all of the selected
user's tweets, we usually get some value between -4 and 4. We then convert the
average polarity score to a sentiment by using the following scale:

Less than -4: extremely negative
Between -4 and -3: very negative
Between -3 and -2: fairly negative
Between -2 and -1: negative
Between -1 and -0.1: slightly negative
Between -0.1 and 0.1: neutral
Between 0.1 and 1: slightly positive
Between 1 and 2: positive
Between 2 and 3: fairly positive
Between 3 and 4: very positive
Greater than 4: extremely positive
